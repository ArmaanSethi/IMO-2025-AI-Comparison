# IMO 2025 AI Solutions Comparison

**Live Project:** [**imo-2025-ai-comparison.vercel.app**](https://imo-2025-ai-comparison.vercel.app/)

This repository is a collaborative, open-source project dedicated to comparing the official AI-generated solutions from leading research labs for the 2025 International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). Our goal is to create a definitive, high-quality resource for the mathematics and AI communities to analyze and discuss the capabilities of current AI models on world-class mathematical problems.

## Project Vision

The International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) represents the pinnacle of pre-collegiate mathematical competition. As AI models grow in their reasoning capabilities, their performance on these complex problems serves as a critical benchmark for the field.

This project aims to:
*   **Centralize Knowledge:** Provide a single, accessible location for the official AI-generated solutions to the 2025 IMO problems.
*   **Facilitate Comparison:** Present the solutions from different models (such as those from Google DeepMind and OpenAI) in a clear, side-by-side format for direct analysis.
*   **Encourage Community Contribution:** Foster a collaborative environment where experts can refine, annotate, and improve the presentation of these solutions to ensure they are an accurate and valuable educational resource.

## Current Status

This project is in its early stages. The solutions for **Problem 1** are available, while the others are placeholders awaiting the official releases. The initial website structure is in place, but we welcome all contributions to enhance its functionality and design.

## How to Contribute

This project thrives on community involvement. We welcome all forms of contribution to help make this a world-class resource. Whether you are a mathematician, a software developer, an AI researcher, or simply an enthusiast, there are many ways to help:

*   **Validate and Annotate Solutions:** Review the AI-generated proofs for correctness, add explanatory comments, or suggest alternative mathematical approaches.
*   **Improve the Website:** Enhance the web interface (`index.html`). This could involve improving the design, adding features for better code and LaTeX rendering, or making it more mobile-friendly.
*   **Expand the Dataset:** Add solutions from other notable AI models as they become available.
*   **Report Issues:** If you find any errors, from mathematical typos to web-based bugs, please open an issue in the GitHub repository.

All contributions will be credited. Please feel free to open a pull request or an issue to get started.

## A Note on the Project's Origins

This project was initiated and built with the significant use of AI assistants, including the generation of the initial code, structure, and this README. It stands as a testament to the power of human-AI collaboration in modern software and knowledge-base creation. The `prompts.txt` file includes some of the prompts used in this process.
