# IMO 2025 AI Comparison: Google DeepMind vs. OpenAI

An open-source project comparing AI-generated solutions from Google DeepMind and OpenAI for the 2025 International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO).

## About This Project

This repository is an open experiment to track and compare the problem-solving capabilities of leading AI models on the challenging problems of the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). We are focusing on the 2025 competition and will be populating this repository with solutions generated by Google DeepMind's and OpenAI's models.

The goal is to create a centralized place for the community to analyze, discuss, and contribute to our understanding of the current state of AI in the field of advanced mathematics.

**A Note on My Experience:** I am not an expert in web development or IMO-level mathematics. This project was built with the help of AI assistants like Gemini, and there are likely many areas for improvement, both in the code and in the mathematical content. I welcome all contributions, corrections, and suggestions!

## Current Status

As of now, only the solution to **Problem 1** is complete. The other problems have been started but are incomplete and require further work.

## How to Contribute

We would love for you to contribute! Here are a few ways you can help:

*   **Improve Existing Solutions:** If you see a mistake or a better way to present a solution, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
*   **Complete Unfinished Problems:** The solutions for Problems 2-5 are still in their early stages. You can help by completing the solutions, adding explanations, or providing alternative approaches.
*   **Add New Solutions:** If you have access to solutions from other AI models or have generated your own, we would be happy to include them.
*   **Improve the Website:** The `main.html` file is a simple viewer for the solutions. If you have web development skills, you could help improve the design, add features, or make it more user-friendly.

When contributing, please try to follow the existing structure of the repository. Each problem has its own set of files, and the solutions are presented in a side-by-side format for easy comparison.

## AI's Role in This Project

This project was heavily reliant on AI assistance. The initial structure, code, and even this README were generated with the help of AI. The `prompts.txt` file contains some of the prompts that were used to generate the content. This is a testament to the power of AI as a tool for learning and building.

## What is the IMO?

The International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) is the most prestigious and difficult mathematics competition for high school students around the world. It consists of six problems, with each problem being worth seven points. The problems are extremely challenging and cover a wide range of mathematical topics, including geometry, number theory, algebra, and combinatorics.

## Google DeepMind vs. OpenAI

Google DeepMind and OpenAI are two of the leading research labs in the field of artificial intelligence. Both have made significant strides in developing AI models that can solve complex problems, including mathematical reasoning. This repository aims to provide a direct comparison of their abilities on a common set of challenging problems.
